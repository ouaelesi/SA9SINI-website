                     We are a group of 7 university students in different fields ( computer 
science, medicine,  and commerce). However we share the same goal 
and the same vision. We unified our ideas and our efforts to come up 
with this website which we aspire that it will realize our purpose in 
giving the support and spreading the sense of altruism.
